* Description:
* HEADLESSECACM.MMP
* Top-level project file for ECACM.CSY. 
* This version of the CSY is used for doing performance testing at the 
* RDevUsbcClient level. When some data comes in, it is immediately written 
* back to the host. If you have something like serial.exe running on the 
* host, you will get a loopback which can be used for gathering data transfer 
* rate information.
* Main usage: 
* 1/ run t_acm on the Lubbock, select ReadOneOrMore
* 2/ run serial.exe on the PC with a packet size of your choosing
* or:
* 1/ run t_acm on the Lubbock, select Read, and give a packet size of N
* 2/ run serial.exe on the PC with a packet size of N
*
